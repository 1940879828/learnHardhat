# Sample Hardhat Project Demo

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with some sample contract, some test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

This project is annotated in both Chinese and English for ease of study

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Lock.ts
```
